### Scientific consulting for art and spaces for art. For those that make it, collect it, care for it, and curate it.



# Art transcends media

With over thirty-five years of conservation science experience in the visual arts, I have applied science to understand and preserve art, not simply the media it is made from. I provide scientific consulting services to support the creation, fabrication, examination, preservation, conservation, display, and storage of art.

> My work has included analysis and care for Old and Modern Masters and contemporary artists working in nearly all forms of modern media. Some notable examples include works by: Albers, Antoni, Barney, Berdecio, Bontecou, Braque, Bruguera, Cai, Cardiff, Cezanne, Clark, Doig, Duchamp, Dürer, Eames, Gallagher, van Gogh, Goya, Klee, de Kooning, Koons, Klutsis, Laib, Lee, Leufert, Matisse, Motherwell, Picasso, Polke, Pollock, Reinhardt, Rembrandt, Rist, Rivera, Rodchenko, Rothko, Schendel, Seurat, Siqueiros, Soutine,  Stieglitz, Strand, Taeuber-Arp, Torres-Garcia, Warhol, Wool, Zittel, Zurbarán.



# Media metamorphosis

I employ an approach that recognizes while media is fundamental, the procedures an artist follows, whether by choice or chance, are what transform matter into art. In addition to the inherent properties of media, the methods artists employ not only drive appearance but can also affect how their work ages. In addition, many modern materials contain embedded factors that can exert change beyond common fading and discoloration processes familiar to many older works of art. These are some of the reasons why I realized shortly after getting involved with modern art that I observed change is greatest for art that is young.

> The forms of artistic media I have been involved with are extensive. I have investigated virtually every class of paint medium used in fine and decorative artwork from the last seven centuries. I have also examined objects made from various metals and metal alloys (ancient and modern), glass, ceramic, and plastic. My background in polymer science has grounded me in the effect processing and molding operations have on fibers, films, and three-dimensional objects as much as it has understanding the impact how paint behaves as it is being manipulated while fluid. I have knowledge of historic materials and processes; some decorative art objects may have inherent vice that, once learned, prompted manufacturers to change either because defects emerged with time, or it was only later proven certain additives (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs) are toxic.  I have also provided conservation and curatorial support related to works on paper, photography, sculpture, textiles (both flat and three-dimensional), time-based media, and performance art.



# Science to preserve both

Scientific methods can advance the understanding of an artwork at the molecular or elemental level and this in turn informs how best to preserve what we appreciate as a visual aesthetic. When expertly interpreted, such technical information can help clients, collectors, conservators, and curators better understand what a particular artwork originally looked like, how it might change if exhibited or stored a certain way, and what the parameters might be for the safest and most effective treatment.

> Throughout my career I have applied or coordinated a wide variety of scientific methods depending upon the nature of the investigation. These methods include essentially every form of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy; and analytical methods such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, synchrotron based small and wide angle x-ray scatter, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry; mechanical testing methods such as differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile testing; and accelerated aging methods such as xenon arc light-testing, microfading, heat and humidity aging methods.

## About

I established Art, Media, Science to provide scientific support to those seeking technical advice to better understand, preserve, and display art. When sympathetically applied, scientific data can best inform and preserve what is essential to an artwork’s aesthetic value. Throughout my museum career I have helped curators and conservators write better informed content and make informed decisions about how to safely and effectively treat art.

My knowledge of the early aging properties of traditional artist’s materials and the novel aging properties of some modern materials is information that is highly valuable to know from a variety of perspectives depending upon whether you make, collect, conserve, or invest in art.

My knowledge is derived from my Masters studies in polymer science with an emphasis on coating technology and nearly four decades of work first at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and then more than twenty years at the Museum of Modern Art where I set up the science section of the conservation department and later had my position endowed. In addition, while simultaneously working at both institutions I taught conservation science to students in the conservation training program at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. My experience in photographic processes, metals, alloys, glasses, and ceramics stems from my development of handheld x-ray fluorescence applied to these art forms which began more than twenty years ago. I have led workshops for the American Institute for Conservation and have lectured and organized workshops in Mexico and China. In 2009, I was a recipient of the College Art Association and the Heritage Preservation Award for Distinction in Scholarship and Conservation.



## Services

Art, Media, Science provides a wide range of consulting services, working as your partner to navigate and make decisions relating to conservation.

* **Exhibition planning.** How do you establish environmental conditions in which artwork can be safely exhibited while staying true to the work’s original intentions.

* **Preservation and storage.** Guidelines for best practice of exhibition and storage for all forms of artistic media.

* **Conservation treatment bid evaluation.** Not sure which bid for conservation treatment is the best? We can provide an expert assessment of these proposals.

* **Artwork lending or donation contracts.** Are you lending or donating art to a museum? We can help provide object-oriented aspects of negotiating with museums for loans and gifts.

* **Guidance on materials.** Do you have an ambitious commission or complicated treatment? We provide guidance on materials, both in traditional and emerging technologies, for artists  and conservators.



### If it’s art to you, I can help if you are curious about it and want to know how best to preserve it.
